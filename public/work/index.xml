      <description>Patients, Doctors, Hospitals and Researchers all connected in real time to maximise health outcomes.
Connect Legacy systems with new emerging standards like [FHIR] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Healthcare_Interoperability_Resources), allowing the old systems to be brought into Modern Software practices.
The platform, called Afira, is designed for the Medical / Health sector and going through beta testing now. We are currently working with the Germany Ministry of Health and other government and standards bodies.
We are currently looking for new partners that wish to leverage the system, so feel free to contact us for a chat.</description>
