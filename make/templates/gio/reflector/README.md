Local Reflector 4.app is where i got rhe PLIST from.

this app does bluetooth and http calls.

its a system that use airplay2 to stream your screen from IOS, IPAD to your mac or Windows.

to work with windows, i guess it has a airplay protocol reciever and so can then show the airplay feed on yoru windows machine.
